# .js Image Slideshow Gallery 

For a demo, see the GitHub pages.: [https://terjeurnes.github.io/js-image-slideshow/](https://terjeurnes.github.io/js-image-slideshow/)

It is a simple fullscreen slideshow and image viewer. That auto detects all images. There are also some features that are selectable, e.g. thumbnail view, autoplay and looping.

### Installing

The slideshow/image viewer  script is all in one file, `image-slideshow.js`. That is all you need to add. Call the initialize function `slideshowInit()` after the body is loaded or the [readyState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState) is interactive. It is an ECMA-script [module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that exports that function. If you do not want to use it as that, you only need to remove the last line of the script.

### Usage: <br> Tagging the images üè∑Ô∏è

The script can collect all images on the page by setting the `SELECT_ALL_IMAGES` constant, the default is `false`. The default behaviour is to select marked single images or all images under a marked parent tag. Marks can be attributes or a class name. Set in the `GALLERY_MARK_ATTRIBUTE` and `GALLERY_MARK_CLASS` constants, default is `data-gallery` and `gallery` respectively.

E.g. `<img src="img01.jpg" data-gallery>` or `<img src="img01.jpg" class="gallery">` or under a parent, or one of its ancestors `<div data-gallery><img src="img01.jpg"><img src="img02.jpg"><div><img src="img03.jpg"></div></div> <div class="gallery"><div><img src="img04.jpg"></div><div><img src="img05.jpg"><img src="img06.jpg"></div></div>` 

### My use case

I use only the full-resolution image, with styling to set the view size. E.g. `<img src="img01.jpg" width="2200" height="1500" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">` 
E.i. I am not using a separate image for the fullscreen view. I don't see any problem because of today's fast internet connections and tools such as ImageOptim that reduces image sizes[^1]. And I don't have sites with critical loading times. The positive with that is no loading time when going into fullscreen view.

### Usage: <br> Image URLs and sizes üñºÔ∏è  

All images need a url and a size of the presented. It is different ways to set that.

The image tag can be setup in different ways. All this examples will give a image with size of 1800 x 1200 pixel.
```
(1) <img src="street-1.jpg" width="1800" height="1200" style="width:100%; height:auto;>
(2) <img src="street-2.jpg" class="gallery" width="1800" height="1200" style="width:100%; height:auto;>
(3) <img src="street-4.jpg" width="1800" height="1200" style="width:100%; height:auto; data-gallery>
(4) <img src="street-3.jpg" data-gallerysize="1800x1200" style="width:100%; height:auto;>
(5) <img src="street-6-small.jpg" width="600" height="400" data-gallerysize="1800x1200" data-galleryimage="street-6.jpg">
```

[^1]: With that tool, the image in the example goes from a size of 1.9MB in full quality out of Lightroom to 400k. Or an 1800x1200, which is still a decent size,  goes from 1.4MB to 270k. All images in the demo site are 1800x1200.
